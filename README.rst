orix is an open-source python library for the analysis of crystal orientations and misorientations.

This repository contains `Jupyter notebooks <http://jupyter.org/>`__ demonstrating core functionality of the orix package.

**Note** If you are using the demos with a release version of orix (e.g. that you have obtained from conda-forge or PyPI) then you should use the corresponding release version of the demos obtained from the Zenodo link above.

**Data** required for all demos are available `here <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ePZbazjk3TFGHWLFHSB20_j0i5QSMnc5>`__ .

If you have problems using any of the notebooks provided here please `raise an issue <https://github.com/pyxem/orix-demos/issues>`__ so that we can help.
